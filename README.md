# Mandelbrot Set

This is a repo for the Mandelbrot bitmap building project of math soft lecture.

The code is mainly from [@wangheyu](https://github.com/wangheyu) and slightly modified by me. ~~Ignore his typo:dog:~~

## How to use

You can generate a bmp file with the following command under directory `/src`

```shell
./run.sh filename ox oy dimension
```

by which you'll create a bitmap image called _filename_ with the origin point of the complex plain on location(_ox_, _oy_), and the window size _dimension_.

## Want to know more?

My essay is in the directory `/doc`, with both `.tex` files and the generated `.pdf` file.
